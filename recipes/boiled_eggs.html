<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Boiled eggs is probably the best and the easiest recipe one should be aware of. An egg contains approximately 6 g of protein and essential amino acids</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Put Eggs in a pan</li>
<li>Add enough water that the eggs are fully submerged. Just fully. No need to add more water as probably you learned in school that specific heat of water is amongst the highest and it would take a lot of energy to raise its temperature and we should conserve energy</li>
<li>Boil the water with eggs in it for 7 min</li>
</ol>
