# odin-recipes
html (basics) project of The Odin Project
The first project of Odin Project 
Skills learned so far: setting up git and github; commit using CLI; CLI basics;
infact, using CLI to explore files and directories instead of GUI and using nano as a text editor
Skills I should be knowing on completion of the whole project: html, css, js, react and nodejs
